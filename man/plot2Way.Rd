\title{Plot two-way interactions from gbm model}
\usage{
plot2Way(
  dw_model,
  variable = c("ws", "air_temp"),
  res = 100,
  exlude = TRUE,
  cols = "default",
  dist = 0.05,
  plot = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dw_model}{Model object from running \code{\link[=buildMod]{buildMod()}}.}

\item{variable}{The variables to plot. Must be of length two e.g. \verb{variables = c("ws", "wd"}.}

\item{res}{Resolution in x-y i.e. number of points in each dimension.}

\item{exlude}{Should surfaces exlude predictions too far from original data?
The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cols}{Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
\dQuote{default}, \dQuote{increment}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet} and user
defined. For user defined the user can supply a list of colour names
recognised by R (type \code{colours()} to see the full list). An example would
be \code{cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")}}

\item{dist}{When plotting surfaces, \code{dist} controls how far from the original
data the predictions should be made. See \code{exclude.too.far} from the \code{mgcv}
package. Data are first transformed to a unit square. Values should be
between 0 and 1.}

\item{plot}{Should a plot be produced? \code{FALSE} can be useful when analysing
data to extract plot components and plotting them in other ways.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed for plotting.}
