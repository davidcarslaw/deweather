\title{Function to apply meteorological normalisation to.}
\usage{
buildMod(
  dat,
  vars = c("trend", "ws", "wd", "hour", "weekday", "temp"),
  pollutant = "nox",
  sam.size = round(2 * nrow(dat)/3),
  n.trees = 200,
  B = 100,
  n.core = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data frame to analyse. Must contain a POSIXct field 
called \code{date}.}

\item{vars}{Explanatory variables to use. These variables will be 
used to build the gbm model. Note that the model must include a
trend component. Several variables can be automatically 
calculated (see \code{\link{prepData}} for details).}

\item{pollutant}{The name of the variable to apply meteorological 
normalisation to.}

\item{sam.size}{The number of random samples to extract from the
data for model building. While it is possible to use the full
data set, for data sets spanning years the model building can
take a very long time to run. Additionally, there will be
diminishing returns in terms of model accuracy. If
\code{sam.size} is greater than the number of number of rows of
data, the number of rows of data is used instead.}

\item{n.trees}{Number of trees to fit.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap simulations for partial dependence 
plots.}

\item{n.core}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing.}
}
\value{
Returns a list including the model, influence data frame 
  and partial dependence data frame.
