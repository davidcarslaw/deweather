\source{
\code{mydata} was compiled from data archived in the London Air
Quality Archive.  See \url{http://www.londonair.org.uk} for site details.

The same data is also provide in \code{'.csv'} format via the openair
project web site \url{http://www.openair-project.org}.

\description{
The \code{dat} dataset is provided as an example dataset as part of the
\code{deweather} package. The dataset contains hourly measurements of air
pollutant concentrations, wind speed and wind direction collected at the
Marylebone (London) air quality monitoring supersite between 1st January 1998
and 23rd June 2005.
}
\details{
\code{dat} is supplied with the \code{rmweather} package as an example
dataset for use with documented examples.
}
\note{
\code{openair} functions generally require data frames with a field
"date" that can be in either \code{POSIXct} or \code{Date} format but
should be GMT time zone. This can be hourly data or higher resolution data.
