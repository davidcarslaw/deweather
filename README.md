**deweather** is an R package developed for the purpose of "removing" the influence of meteorology from air quality time series data. The package uses a *boosted regression tree* approach for modelling air quality data. These and similar techniques provide powerful tools for building statistical models of air quality data. They are able to take account of the many complex interactions between variables as well as non-linear relationships between the variables.

## üí° Core Features

**deweather** makes it straightforward to test, build, and evaluate models in R.

- **Test and build meteorological normalisation models** flexibly using `testMod()` and `buildMod()`.

- **Plot and examine models** in a myriad of ways, including visualising partial dependencies, using functions like `plotPD()` and `plot2Way()`.

- **Apply meteorological averaging** using `metSim()` to obtain a meteorologically normalised air quality timeseries.

Modelling can be computationally intensive and therefore **deweather** makes use of the parallel processing, which should work on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.
